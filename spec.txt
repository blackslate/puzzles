I want to create:
* A fixed width nav pane on the left
* A flexible width pane on the right with a black background
* A square area which fills the width or the height of the right-hand pane 

I can use vmin to get the minimum dimension of the entire window, but the usable width may be narrower than that.

I can create a div which has
* no height
* a padding of 100%
* a width of 100%
